# wakeup

This is just a simple alarm clock program in Go; it demonstrates http://github.com/andlabs/ui. The source should be self-explanatory; feel free to make suggestions.

To install:

1. Make sure you are using Go >= 1.3.  See http://golang.org/dl/#go1.3rc1.
2. Run:

```sh
$ go get github.com/andlabs/wakeup
```

If your `$GOPATH/bin` directory is in your path, you should be able to just run:

```sh
$ wakeup
```

from the command line.


## TODO
- switch to a proper date control when one is added to package ui
