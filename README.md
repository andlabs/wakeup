# wakeup

This is just a simple alarm clock program in Go; it demonstrates http://github.com/andlabs/ui. The source should be self-explanatory; feel free to make suggestions.

To install:

```sh
$ go get github.com/andlabs/wakeup
```

You must be on Go 1.3.

## TODO
- switch to a proper date control when one is added to package ui
